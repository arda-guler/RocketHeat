NOTES:
	DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF INPUT VALUES ABOVE! 
	DO NOT EDIT THE UNITS OF INPUT VALUES! UNITS ARE HARD CODED!
	(You can edit the lines, just keep the order and units.)
	
	Any lines below this point can be used for comments.
	
	Outer shell material is not important and is not used for any
	calculations.
	
	Available materials are:
	- Stainless Steel 304L (SS)
	- Copper Chromium Zirconium (CCZ)
	- Jet A1 (Jet A1)
	
	When choosing materials, use the exact string written in the 
	parantheses in the list above. Otherwise, the program won't
	recognize the material.
